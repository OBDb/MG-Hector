    description: "The MG Hector marked the British brand's reentry into the Indian market under Chinese ownership (SAIC Motor), positioned as a mid-size SUV competing in the popular segment. Based on the Baojun 530 sold in China, the Hector featured distinctive styling with a large chrome-studded grille, split LED daytime running lights positioned above the main headlamp units, and prominent chrome trim. Available with multiple powertrain options including a 1.5-liter turbocharged petrol engine producing 143 horsepower, a 1.5-liter petrol with a 48V mild hybrid system for improved efficiency, and a 2.0-liter diesel engine delivering 170 horsepower. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic for petrol variants, and a 6-speed manual for diesel models. The Hector's standout feature was its technology package, dubbed 'Internet Inside,' which included a 10.4-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen infotainment system with embedded SIM for connected features, voice commands, over-the-air updates, and remote vehicle controls through a smartphone app. Interior space was generous with a focus on rear seat comfort, featuring reclining rear seats and ample legroom. Safety features included up to six airbags, electronic stability control, traction control, and a 360-degree camera on higher variants. The first-generation Hector became a significant player in the Indian market, helping establish MG as a technology-focused brand competing with established players like Hyundai and Tata."

    description: "The updated MG Hector received comprehensive styling and feature upgrades while maintaining the same basic platform and dimensions. Most notably, the front fascia was redesigned with an even more prominent 'Argyle-inspired' diamond mesh grille extending across the front end, updated LED headlamps, and revised bumpers. The rear received new connected LED taillights with a chrome strip running across the tailgate. The most significant enhancements came inside, with a completely redesigned dashboard centered around a larger 14-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen infotainment systemâ€”the largest in its segment. The updated system features improved processing power, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and enhanced connected car features including more advanced voice commands supporting over 100 functions. New luxury features include a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, ventilated front seats, a 360-degree camera with blind spot view monitor, and a premium Infinity audio system with eight speakers. Safety technology expanded with the addition of Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) including adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and traffic sign recognition. Powertrain options remained similar to the previous generation, with 1.5-liter turbocharged petrol (with and without mild hybrid technology) and 2.0-liter diesel engines paired with manual or automatic transmissions. Interior space continues to be a strength, with the five-seater version offering generous passenger room and cargo capacity. The refreshed Hector builds on the success of its predecessor by focusing on enhanced technology, luxury features, and safety equipment to maintain its competitive position in the crowded mid-size SUV segment."
